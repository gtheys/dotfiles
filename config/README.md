# Setting up NeoVim

Wanted to play with nvim. It seems it's ready to replace the CLI vim. 

Because I did not know anything about it I took this from [nicknisi dotfikes](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles).

I manually copy this to `~/.nvim -> ~/.dotfiles/config/nvim`. Should also copy his copy script. But next time when I need to roll out I'm going to revise my complete deploy structure too.
