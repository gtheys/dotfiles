# Dotfiles

## 🙋‍♂️Introduction

Currently I migrated all my workstations to arch linux. This is why I cleaned up my repo to just have my linux configuration. I will restructure it to be more clean and easier for myself.

Use the repository to browse for inspiration. It will not run easily as it still needs a lot of work an nuturing. There will be loads of changes incoming.

You can find the windows part in the keep-windows branch. I will proably pull it out to another windots repository as I still run a backup windows install. Mostly for gaming or updating laptop drivers.
