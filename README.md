Nick Nisi has always been an inspiration for my own dotfiles. I'm not
maintaining them often enough to warrant my own. Why this repo you might ask? I
merge his changed in this repo before I use them so I can keep my own changes in
an easy way. Merging helps me also to understand the new features he adds to his
repo. Please check him out he is awesome :)
